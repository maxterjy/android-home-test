# Android Home Test  

## Summary
Thanks TIKI Corporation for your consideration for my application for the position of Android Developer.  
The assignment is really challenging and interesting. It help me to learn new knowledge during doing the assigment.  
And below is my result.  
  
I have built an Android application, that:  
* Fetch and display json data on the link that you give.  
* The home screen can update together with the changes of below data:  
* * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tikivn/android-home-test/v2/keywords.json  
* * https://github.com/maxterjy/android-home-test/tree/master/online-data  
* In hotkey features, if the keyword is more than one word, then display in two lines. These two lines should have minimum difference in length.  
* Besides, I research TIKI application and modify my UI as the design of TIKI. That really help my application have a better look.  
* During doing the exam, I have used some icons of TIKI. So sorry, because I used without asking you.  

You can find the apk at [here](https://github.com/maxterjy/android-home-test/blob/master/apk/HomeTest_v1.apk).  
There are still errors and need-to-improve points int my application. But I hope you accept it.  

## Development
* Volley library is used to perform HTTP GET request and receive response.  
* ViewModel is used to storage data.  
* Fragment observes the data through LiveData.  
* Data binding is used to reduce findViewById() calls.
